# hypothesis_test

This is the note I took about hypothesis test which includes:

[Z Test](./z_test/z_test.ipynb)

[T Test](./t_test/t_test.ipynb)

[ANOVA](./ANOVA/ANOVA.ipynb)

[Chi Squared Test](./chi2_test/chi2_test.ipynb)

All the notes were taken in the python Jupyter notebook. 
In each Jupyter notebook, I solved some simple problems with hypothesis testing to showcase how the test is conducted.
The answers for these questions are in the pdf file which you can check it in the resources folder.
The resources folders also contain materials for a more thorough explanation of hypothesis test.

This project is just a note I took when I learned statistics. 
I linked some of the articles and YouTube vedios from which I solve my confusion in "REFERENCE" in the python Jupyter notebook.
I also used pictures in the notebook to better illustrate hypothesis testing, but since the pictures were from various sources, I might fail to list all of their references.
